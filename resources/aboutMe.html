                        I opted for a change of career.  I have developed excellent customer service skills, superlative communication skills, and have developed a bit of a creative spark as well.  Software Development gives me 
                        the opportunity to build something of my own, problem solve, and work collaboratively on projects with others while utilizing some of the 
                        necessary skills I have acquired along the way.  I wanted a change in pace to allow myself a bit more freedom on the home-front and be able 
                        to manage my time more efficiently.  I look forward to what I can achieve within the field!

                <p id="aboutme2">
                I have always been a goal oriented person. Since a very young age, I sought out a career in veterinary medicine, worked hard for it even.  
                Throughout my undergraduate degree I continue my conquest and ventured forward towards the awe-inspriing career that is Veterinary Medicine; a life-long 
                of learning and growing, sounds great!  Throughout my venture within veterinary school I found myself briefly questioning the decision of whether it was the right fit for me.
                But of course, I brushed those thoughts from my mind and looked forward; as the goal was right in front of me.  I loved the learning aspect of the field; to forever grow is a dream,
                and a dream it remains.  I achieved my doctorate degree and found myself as an emergency medicine veterinarian.  I placed myself in the field as it was the best place to learn, 
                mold, and grow as a veterinarian.  I had incredible mentorship and became an amazing doctor.  I had all of the resources at my disposal.  <br><br>

                Then, reality hit.  The long 14-16 hour shifts.  Making medical decisions that result in whether something lives or dies.  The absolutely ruin that is the financial limitations
                of the population.  The populus questioning whether you really do care about the animals and not understanding there is no government funding behind veterinary medicine to help
                fund medical bills.  There are insurances that also cost an arm and a leg for people who can hardly afford a roof over their head.  And yet, there I was amongst it all.  The life
                    I so longed for.  That thought lingered back into my head.  Truly, my mental health and physical health took a significant toll as the frequent shifting of sleep schedules, 
                    the sadness and reality that takes hold of the career, and the immense exhaustion that came following a set of shifts took their hold.  Slowly, I felt over-encumbered, unable to even
                    care for even myself, let alone another life. <br><br>

                    I worked for three years in the career that is veterinary medicine.  And I may go back at some point in the distant future.  But it is time for a change.  So here I am, currently 
                    trying to teach myself how to become a software developer as it is another career filled with life long learning.  I have opted to take 6 months off in order to try to focus on 
                    my physical, mental, and career development. Which brings us to today.  I carry the experience of managing a team of individuals, growing with a team, and lending a hand to those 
                    in need of assistance.  Thank you for reading my story as it has impacted my life significantly.

                    <div><p>I got my Bachelors of Biological Science in 2015 from Coastal Carolina University.  During that time period
                        I focused a majority of my studies to biological science and worked for an animal hospital during that time as well.  In 2019,
                        I obtained my Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Georgia; again, mostly focusing on animal medicine and sciences. 
                        I had a job throughout school to help within the teaching hospital every week.

                    <div><p>
                        Right out of my graduate program I obtained a position 
                        as a new emergency veterinarian with the EMERGE program through BluePearl.  Over the course of a year, the program had primary focus on emergency
                        medicine and I had incredible mentorship at that time.  For the next two years, I practiced veterinary medicine as a full-time emergency veterinarian.
                        In the middle of the year 2022, I retired from my position as an emergency veterinarian and pursued self-learning in a different field; software development.

                        In the middle of the year 2022, I retired from my position as an emergency veterinarian and pursued self-learning in a different field; software development.
                        Using Codecademy as a primary resource for self-learning, I have developed skills utilizing python syntax, SQL , html, CSS, and javascript syntax.  As I further my development, 
                        I plan to get experience throughout the entire software development experience and become a full stack developer.
